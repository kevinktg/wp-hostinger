Streamdown

A drop-in replacement for react-markdown, designed for AI-powered streaming.

```
npx ai-elements add response
```

or install it directly with `npm i streamdown`

## Overview

Formatting Markdown is easy, but when you tokenize and stream it, new challenges arise.

With [AI Elements](https://ai-sdk.dev/elements), we wanted a way to stream safe and perfectly formatted Markdown without having to worry about the details.

So we built Streamdown, a drop-in replacement for react-markdown, designed for AI-powered streaming.

It powers the AI Elements [Response](https://ai-sdk.dev/elements/components/response) component, but you can install it as a standalone package if you want.

```
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';

import { useState } from 'react';

import { Response } from '@/components/ai-elements/response';

export default function Page() {

  const { messages, sendMessage, status } = useChat();

  const [input, setInput] = useState('');

  return (

    <>

      {messages.map(message => (

        <div key={message.id}>

          {message.parts.filter(part => part.type === 'text').map((part, index) => (

            <Response key={index}>{part.text}</Response>

          ))}

        </div>

      ))}

      <form

        onSubmit={e => {

          e.preventDefault();

          if (input.trim()) {

            sendMessage({ text: input });

            setInput('');

          }

        }}

      >

        <input

          value={input}

          onChange={e => setInput(e.target.value)}

          disabled={status !== 'ready'}

          placeholder="Say something..."

        />

        <button type="submit" disabled={status !== 'ready'}>

          Submit

        </button>

      </form>

    </>

  );

}
```
